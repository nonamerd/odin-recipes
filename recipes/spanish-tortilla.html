    <p class="description">STEPS to create a beautiful gooey spanish tortilla.</p>
                
                <ol>     
                <li>Peel the potatoes and place them in a bowl of cold water.
                <li>Using a mandolin, slice the potatoes into 3mm-thin rounds.
                <li>Rinse the potatoes under running water until the water runs clear.
                <li>In a pot of hot oil at 160°C (320°F), fry the potatoes until dry and crisp (ensuring all the moisture is evaporated).
                <li>Place the fried potatoes on a tray lined with kitchen tissue and set aside for 1 hour to further dry out.
                <li>While the potatoes are resting, caramelize the onions in a pan of oil until golden brown, then let cool.
                <li>In a bowl, crack the eggs and whisk them (pass them through a fine sieve to ensure there are no shells).
                <li>In a pan, heat oil slightly, then add the onions to warm them up. Add the fried potatoes.
                <li>Gently fold the potatoes; once the potatoes are softened, set the mix aside to absorb and cool to room temperature.
                <li>Then add the eggs and fold gently until the potatoes start to rehydrate and soften..             
                <li>Allow the mix to sit for 10-15 minutes; you’ll know it’s ready when the potatoes are rehydrated and not rubbery..             
                <li>Move the pan in a circular motion on medium-high heat for roughly 6 minutes.
                <li>Oil a tray and flip the tortilla onto it, then gently slide it back into the pan. 
                <li>Moving in the same circular motion, seal the tortilla and cook for a further 2-4 minutes.
                <li>Serve the tortilla with lemon mayo and chives.
                </ol>
