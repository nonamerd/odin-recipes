        <h2>RECIPE</h2>
            <ol><b>      
<li>        Peel the potatoes and place them in a bowl of cold water.
<li>        Using a mandolin, slice the potatoes into 3mm-thin rounds.
<li>        Rinse the potatoes under running water until the water runs clear.
<li>        In a pot of hot oil at 160°C (320°F), fry the potatoes until dry and crisp (ensuring all the moisture is evaporated).
<li>        Place the fried potatoes on a tray lined with kitchen tissue and set aside for 1 hour to further dry out.
<li>        While the potatoes are resting, caramelise the onions in a pan of oil until golden brown, then let cool.
<li>        In a bowl, crack the eggs and whisk them (pass them through a fine sieve to ensure there are no shells).
<li>        In a pan, heat oil slightly, then add the onions to warm them up. Add the fried potatoes.
<li>        Gently fold the potatoes; once the potatoes are softened, set the mix aside to absorb and cool to room temperature.
<li>        Then add the eggs and fold gently until the potatoes start to rehydrate and soften..             
<li>        Allow the mix to sit for 10-15 minutes; you’ll know it’s ready when the potatoes are rehydrated and not rubbery..             
<li>        In a non-stick 12cm pan or 5 inch pan, add oil and heat it up..             Once the oil is heated, add the tortilla mix to fill the pan. 
<li>        Move the pan in a circular motion on medium-high heat for roughly 6 minutes.
<li>        Oil a tray and flip the tortilla onto it, then gently slide it back into the pan. 
<li>        Moving in the same circular motion, seal the tortilla and cook for a further 2-4 minutes.
<li>        Serve the tortilla with lemon mayo and chives.
